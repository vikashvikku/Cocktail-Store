        A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink. Most commonly, cocktails are
        either a single spirit or a combination of spirits, mixed with other
        ingredients such as juices, flavored syrups, tonic water, shrubs, and
        bitters. Cocktails vary widely across regions of the world, and many
        websites publish both original recipes and their own interpretations of
        older and more famous cocktails.
